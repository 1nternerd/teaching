# Hi there! Welcome to my teaching materials

I'm working on two Information Retrieval courses at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien). We teach one course each semester: 

- The **Introdcution to Information Retrieval** course focuses on IR basics and engineering skills of the students.
- The **Advanced Information Retrieval** course focuses on machine learning and neural IR techniques.

*I will add more lecture slides & notes as I create them in the future.*

**Please feel free to open up an issue or a pull request if you want to add something, find a mistake, or think something should be explained better!**
